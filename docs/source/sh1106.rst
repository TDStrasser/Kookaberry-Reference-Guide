.. module:: sh1106
   :synopsis: control of SH1106 based displays

This module provides a class to control SH1106 display drivers, which is used
by the internal display on the Kookaberry.  The class is derived from the
:class:`framebuf.FrameBuffer` class so inherits all drawing methods from that
class.  The display is double-buffered, meaning that any modifications to the
pixels are only updated on the physical display when the ``show()`` method is
called.

Example usage::

    import kooka

    # print some text (will display it immediately)
    kooka.display.print('hello', 1234)

    # turn on a pixel and show it
    kooka.display.pixel(0, 0, 1)
    kooka.display.show()

.. _sh1106.SH1106_SPI:

class SH1106_SPI
================

This class represents a connection to the display.  It is derived from the
:class:`framebuf.FrameBuffer` class so inherits all drawing methods from that
class.

Constructors
------------

.. class:: SH1106_SPI(width, height, spi, cs, dc)

    Creates a new instance of this class with the following parameters:

        - *width* and *height* are the pixel dimensions of the display.

        - *spi* is the :class:`machine.SPI` object connected to the display.

        - *cs* and *dc* are the :class:`machine.Pin` objects corresponding to the
          chip-select and data-command lines respectively.

    When the object is constructed the display is turned on and the pixels
    all cleared.

Methods
-------

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.init_display()

    Initialises and clears the display.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.poweroff()

    Turns off the display.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.poweron()

    Turns on the display.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.contrast(value)

    Sets the contrast of the display to the given *value*, between 0 and 255
    inclusive.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.invert(value)

    If *value* is true then the display colours are inverted, otherwise they
    are normal.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.show()

    Draw the internal display buffer to the physical display.

.. method:: SH1106_SPI.print(\*args, sep= ' ')

    This method is intedend to be equivalent to the built-in ``print()`` method,
    but it prints to the display instead of the serial prompt.

    The given arguments are converted to strings and then drawn to the display
    using the current font (defaults to 8x8 font).  The display is scrolled up
    when text is drawn to the last line of the display.

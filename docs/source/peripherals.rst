Peripherals Module Library
--------------------------

The **Kookaberry** provides an ever-growing module library to enable on-board devices and a range of external accessories to be used by the software.  
Further modules can be added by users for peripherals and accessories of their choosing.  

There are many Internet forums and repositories that provide module software code and help on getting accessories to work with 
**MicroPython** micro-computers such as the **Kookaberry**. Notable among the repositories is GitHub.

The Kookaberry's built-in software modules are described in the following sections.

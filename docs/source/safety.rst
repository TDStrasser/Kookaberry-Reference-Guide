Safety Guide
============

The guidance below will help you to use your **Kookaberry** safely. 

We suggest you retain this information for future reference and share it with your students if you are a teacher.

The **Kookaberry** is an exposed electronics circuit board with all the parts on display so you can see how the electronics are assembled.  
This means there is a small risk that the parts can be damaged by inappropriate handling or use which is beyond the **Kookaberry’s** design tolerances.

Recommended Operating Environment
---------------------------------

* Temperature range: 0 to 40 degrees Centigrade.
* Humidity: 10% to 90% relative humidity.  
* Do not allow the circuit board or any electrically connected item to become wet or to be immersed in any liquid. 
* Do not handle the **Kookaberry** nor any electrical attachments with wet hands. 
* Conversely on days with low humidity, keep away from synthetic fabrics, clothes and carpets 
  as these can store high static electricity charges which will damage the **Kookaberry**. 

Storage
-------

When stored, the **Kookaberry** should be in an environment within a temperature range of -10
to 50 degrees centigrade, and be protected against moisture, static electricity and also from
physical knocks and scratches.

When not being used, keep the **Kookaberry** in the plastic pouch in which it was supplied. 
This protects against damage from static electricity, and also from physical knocks and scratches.

Power Connection
----------------

The **Kookaberry** may be powered by a compatible battery, supplying from 4.5V DC to 9V DC maximum, 
which is connected to the JST-PH 2-pin Power connector on the rear of the circuit board to the right of the Reset button. 

Alternatively, power can be supplied from a 5V DC USB-compliant battery pack or computer connection via the USB connector 
at the top-centre of the rear of the circuit board. 

Do not power the **Kookaberry** directly from a USB charger, nor from a battery being simultaneously charge, 
as damage or erroneous operation or damage could occur.


Conductive Materials
--------------------

Do not allow metal or any other conductive material to come into contact with the **Kookaberry** circuit board, 
with the exception of approved connections to the provided plugs and sockets.

Contamination, Shocks and Scratches
-----------------------------------

Handle the **Kookaberry** only by the circuit board edges, avoiding contact with the gold-plated expansion connector at the bottom of the circuit board.  

Do not drop or allow the **Kookaberry** to collide with any hard or sharp objects that may shock, puncture, scratch or dislodge the **Kookaberry’s** components.
The **Kookaberry’s** display contains fragile glass which could easily break. 
If damage is apparent, cease using the **Kookaberry** and consult your supplier for advice.

Cleaning
--------

If the **Kookaberry** should become soiled, remove all power and attempt to clean with a soft damp cloth.  

In extreme cases, alcohol (methylated spirits) or lens cleaner may be used.  Allow to thoroughly dry before reconnecting to power.  

Do not use any other chemicals or solvents!

Children
--------

The **Kookaberry** is intended for use by children from 8 years of age under the supervision of a responsible adult.  

.. important::
   
   **Do not leave the Kookaberry within reach of children under 8 years of age.**

Accessories
-----------

The **Kookaberry** is designed for use with a range of compatible electronic accessories, connected via connectors P1 to P5 and/or 
the expansion connector using compatible expansion boards.  

Such accessories must be used in accordance with their safety information.  

To be compatible with and not damaging to the **Kookaberry**, accessories must operate at signal (GPIO Pin) voltages not exceeding 3.3V DC.

Some accessories may require a power supply voltage that is more than 3.3V DC. 
Such accessories cannot be powered by the **Kookaberry** and will need a suitable external power adapter.

Power for accessories must in aggregate not draw more then 150 milli-amps directly from the **Kookaberry**.  

The **Kookaberry** is protected from short-term excess current but will be damaged by voltages from external accessories exceeding 3.3 volts 
being applied to any connector, other than the external power input connector.

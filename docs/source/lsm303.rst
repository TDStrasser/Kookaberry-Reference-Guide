.. module:: lsm303
   :synopsis: control of LSM303C accelerometer/magnetometer

This module provides classes to control an LSM303C combined accelerometer and
magnetometer.  It is used internally by the Kookaberry to provide access to the
internal LSM303C, but can also be used to control an external chip.

The LSM303C provides two independent I2C slaves for the accelerometer and
magnetometer, with default I2C addresses of ``0x1d`` and ``0x1e`` respectively.

Example usage::

    import machine, lsm303

    i2c = machine.I2C('LSM') # internal I2C bus with internal LSM303C

    accel = lsm303.LSM303C_Accel(i2c)
    mag = lsm303.LSM303C_Mag(i2c)

    print(accel.get_xyz(), mag.get_strength())

Note that the i2c object can be any valid machine.I2C object.  For example, you
can use the P1 connector via::

    i2c = machine.I2C('P1')

.. _lsm303.LSM303C_Accel:

class LSM303C_Accel
===================

This class represents a connection to the accelerometer part of the LSM303C.

Constructors
------------

.. class:: LSM303C_Accel(i2c, addr=0x1d)

    Creates a new instance of this class.  *i2c* should be a :class:`machine.I2C`
    object that the LSM303C is connected to.  *addr* is the I2C address of the
    accelerometer, which defaults to 0x1d if not specified.

Methods
-------

.. method:: LSM303C_Accel.get_xyz()

    Returns the current x/y/z values of the accelerometer as a 3-tuple.

.. _lsm303.LSM303C_Mag:

class LSM303C_Mag
=================

This class represents a connection to the magnetometer part of the LSM303C.

Constructors
------------

.. class:: LSM303C_Mag(i2c, addr=0x1e)

    Creates a new instance of this class.  *i2c* should be a machine.I2C object
    that the LSM303C is connected to.  *addr* is the I2C address of the
    magnetometer, which defaults to 0x1e if not specified.

Methods
-------

.. method:: LSM303C_Mag.get_xyz()

    Returns the current x/y/z values of the magnetometer as a 3-tuple.
    These values are filtered with a moving average of the last 4 samples.

.. method:: LSM303C_Mag.get_heading()

    Returns a simple measure of the compass heading via the formula
    math.atan2(y, x).

.. method:: LSM303C_Mag.get_strength()

    Returns the magnitude of the 3-vector returned by LSM303C_Mag.get_xyz(),
    as an integer.

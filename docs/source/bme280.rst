Class BME280
============

This module provides the interfaces to use the BME280 and BMP280 sensors.  These sensors
The contents of the bme280 module are:
 
The BME280 class in this module provides the principal functionality, and its contents are:

Example usage::

    from machine import SoftI2C, Pin
    import BME280
    i2c = SoftI2C(Pin(‘P3’))
    sensor = bme280.BME280(i2c=i2c, mode=4, address=0x77)


The arguments above are:
•	I2c is an I2C interface object which has been created using machine.SoftI2C().
•	mode is the setting for oversampling of the humidity value, and has the default value shown if omitted.
•	address is the i2c address of the bme280 sensor, usually hexadecimal 0x77 (which is 119 decimal).


The module presents the sensor readings as properties.

Properties::

    temperature, pressure, humidity = sensor.values

Where:
•	temperature: is the temperature in degrees Celsius.
•	pressure: is the atmospheric pressure in hectoPascals.
•	humidity: is the relative humidity in percent.

Altitude::

    altitude = sensor.altitude
    
The altitude is in metres and is calculated based on the value given to the property bme.sealevel (see below). 
This value does not have to be the sea-level pressure, but any pressure you may select, for instance to measure altitude difference in general.

Sea level may be both read and set::

    sensor.sealevel = sealevel
    sealevel = sensor.sealevel


The default sealevel pressure is 1013.25 hPa, but you can use your local published pressure in hPa (look up QNH on your meteorological website),
or set a local pressure to determine altitude difference.

Dew Point::

    dew_point = sensor.dew_point


Provides the dew_point temperature (°C) calculated from the actual temperature and humidity.

Sensor Type::

    type = sensor.sensor


Provides a sensor type as a string variable being one of ('BMP280','BME280','BME680', or 'unknown') depending on the sensor id
in the relevant sensor hardware register.

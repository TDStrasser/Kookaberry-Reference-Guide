.. _veml7700:

The VEML7700 is a high-accuracy ambient light sensor with an I2C serial interface to the **Kookaberry**.

The ambient light readings are measured in Lux. 
Lux is the unit of illuminance, or luminous flux per unit area, in the International System of Units (SI), and is equal to one lumen per square metre. 
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux for more detail.

The interface with the **Kookaberry** is the I2C serial communications bus. 
I2C stands for Inter-Integrated-Circuit Communications (IIC or I2C). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C for more detail.

There are four wires in the I2C interface, being: 

* Vcc power at +3.3 volts DC 
* * Gnd ground (or negative) for signal and power at 0 volts 
* * SCL being the serial clock signal for communications timing 
* * SDA being the serial data signal which conveys the digital data being communicated

When using a VEML7700 circuit board it is important that these signals are connected to the correct Pins on the **Kookaberry**.

The VEML7700 data-sheet may be obtained from https://www.vishay.com/docs/84286/veml7700.pdf.


Class VEML7700
==============


Example Usage::

    # Read the light level at 1 second intervals

    import veml7700
    from machine import Pin, SoftI2C
    from kooka import display
    import time

    i2c = SoftI2C(scl=Pin('P3A'), sda=Pin('P3B')) # set up the I2C interface
    sensor = veml7700.VEML7700(i2c)               # create the lux meter object

    while True:  # Loop runs forever
        display.fill(0)      # Clear the display
        display.print("Light Lux Meter")
        display.print(sensor.read_lux(), "Lux")
        # Wait for 1 second
        time.sleep(1)



VEML7700 Constructor
--------------------

.. class:: veml7700.VEML7700(i2c=None, address=0x10, it=25, gain=1/8, **kwargs)

    Creates the VEML7700 sensor object and initialises it according to the arguments given.

    *i2c* should be a :class:`machine.SoftI2C` object.

    *address* defaults to the only address available for the VEML770 which is ``0x10``.

    *it* is the integration time which defaults to 25 milliseconds (See Table 1 in the data-sheet)

    *gain* is the ambient light sensor gain which defaults to 1/8 (See Table 1 in the data-sheet)

    *kwargs* are any other parameters to be passed through (there are none so it can be omitted)

    

VEML7700 Methods
----------------

.. method:: VEML7700.init()

    (Re)loads the calibration data into the chip's calibration registers.

.. method:: VEML7700.read_lux()

    Reads the data from the sensor and returns the light reading in Lux.
    
    The frequency to read the sensor should be set greater than the integration time.
    Reading at a faster frequency will not cause an error, but will result in reading the previous sensor data.

    The method incorporates an inherent delay of 40 milliseconds.

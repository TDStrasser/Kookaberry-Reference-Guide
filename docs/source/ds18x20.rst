Module ds18x20
The DS18B20 sensor is a digital thermometer that communicates over a onewire serial interface.  These sensors have a range of -55 to +125 degrees Celsius with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees C for between -10 to +85 degrees C. Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same onewire bus. Using the ds18x20 module, it is simple to use the Kookaberry to use multiple DS18B20s to sense the temperatures at different points.  The DS18B20 comes in diverse packaging, including waterproof probes for sensing in liquids.
The content of the ds18x20 module is:
 
To make use of the ds18x20 module, follow this programming example:
from onewire import OneWire
from umachine import Pin
import time
from ds18x20 import DS18X20
sensor = DS18X20(OneWire(Pin('P4'))) # define the sensor object
roms = sensor.scan() # discover all sensors on the onewire bus
while True: # run in this loop forever
    sensor.convert_temp() # initiate sensing for all sensors
    time.sleep(1) # give the sensors time to get ready
    for probe in roms: # read the sensors one at a time in turn
        temperature = probe.read_temp(probe)
        print('Probe: %s Temperature: %0.1f' % (probe,temperature))

The functions read_scratch() and write_scratch() are used internally by the module and are not usually used by external programs.

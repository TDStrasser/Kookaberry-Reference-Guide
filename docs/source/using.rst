Using the Kookaberry
====================

Using the **Kookaberry** is relatively simple and as described below.

Power-up
--------

The simplest way to power-up the **Kookaberry** is to connect it:

- to a computer via the **Kookaberry’s** USB port using a compatible USB cable
- to a USB battery via the **Kookaberry’s** USB port using a compatible USB cable or
- to a battery, having a voltage between 4.5 to 9.0 volts, via the **Kookaberry**'s 2 pin JST-PH battery connector

   Powering the Kookaberry

When power is applied, a green LED on the back of the **Kookaberry** should illuminate.  

If you see a slowly pulsing blue LED then the battery voltage is too low.  
Charge or replace the battery and try again.

If no LED lights then the battery is not connected, or not switched on, or is completely flat. 
Check that 

* the USB / battery cable is completely plugged in
* the cabling and plugs are not damaged
* any battery pack switch is on
* that the battery packs are charged


Menu Start-up
-------------

The **Kookaberry** has an in-built menu for running scripts that are stored in the **Kookaberry**'s file storage.

   Starting the Kookaberry's inbuilt menu

Any **MicroPython** scripts that are stored in the **Kookaberry**'s app folder will be listed and available to be run.

Programming
-----------

To code **MicroPython** scripts, use one of the **KookaSuite** programming tools.

First connect the **Kookaberry** to a USB port on a personal computer which has **KookaSuite** installed.

The **Kookaberry** should be recognised as a USB drive.

Launch **KookaBlockly** or **KookaIDE** and write your script, or load a script already written from your Kookaberry Scripts folder.

Click on the Run button in the **KookaSuite** tool to transfer the program to the Kookaberry and run it.
